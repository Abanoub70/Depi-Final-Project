# Introduction
st.header("📍 Problem Definition")
st.markdown("""
Rossmann, one of Europe’s largest drugstore chains, operates over **3,000 stores in 7 countries**, with **1,115 stores in Germany** alone.

Store managers must forecast **daily sales up to six weeks in advance**. These forecasts are essential for:

- 📦 **Inventory control**
- 👥 **Staff scheduling**
- 📈 **Operational efficiency**

However, sales are affected by many dynamic factors such as:

- Promotional campaigns  
- Local competition  
- School and state holidays  
- Store location and demographics  
- Seasonality and trends  

To address this challenge, Rossmann hosted a **Kaggle competition** aimed at building a robust machine learning model for **daily sales forecasting**.

# Project Goals
st.header("🎯 Project Objectives")
st.markdown("""
1. **Analyze and explore** the Rossmann dataset (sales, promotions, holidays, stores).
2. **Identify important factors** influencing sales performance.
3. **Preprocess and clean** the data for use in machine learning models.
4. **Build forecasting models** such as:
   - Linear Regression  
   - Decision Trees  
   - Random Forest  
   - XGBoost  
   - LSTM (for time series)
5. **Evaluate models** using metrics like **RMSE** or **MAE**.
6. **Optimize** the best model with hyperparameter tuning.
7. **Deliver insights** and recommendations to support better planning and store-level decision-making.

# Methodology
st.header("🛠️ Project Methodology")
st.markdown("""
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Identify patterns and visualize sales drivers.

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Encode categories, handle missing values, and create useful features like weekday/holiday flags.

- **Modeling:**  
  Test multiple models, optimize performance, and validate results.

- **Evaluation:**  
  Compare models using hold-out data and key metrics.

- **Insights & Reporting:**  
  Share practical recommendations for improving sales strategy.
