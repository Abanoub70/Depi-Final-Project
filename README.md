# E-Commerce Sales Analysis and Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting **e-commerce sales** using **Microsoft Power BI** and **Machine Learning**. The goal is to extract actionable insights from sales data and develop a predictive model to forecast future trends.

## 📊 Key Features
- **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Preprocessing raw sales data, handling missing values, and ensuring data accuracy.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating interactive dashboards using **Microsoft Power BI** to analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Developing a predictive model using **Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or XGBoost** to forecast future sales.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy using **RMSE, MAE, and R² scores**.
- **Business Insights**: Providing actionable recommendations to optimize sales, inventory, and marketing strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Power BI** (or Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data visualization
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost) for data analysis and ML modeling
- **Jupyter Notebook** for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model development
- **Git & GitHub** for version control
